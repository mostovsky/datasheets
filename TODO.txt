TODO

* add command "need rename" for case when open PDF in browser (we can see and rename easy when in browser opened)


* multiple check in procedure for all input words (include translit)

* make ckeck for different system words: "Search" or "search" and make translit system-words if nothing founded

* for search: https://www.rlocman.ru/datasheet/search.html?q=

* direct web-link to open local search

* duplicate delete
+* true rename: if exist prev file with wrong name - bad

* add "all" for open all founded items

* cannot start in command to multiple search (can't use "| find /i %sometext%") - it's bad

* add forced search by word "search" or "find"

* add if serch in path open as dir if "dir" was added in ask

* in internet search use only english-letters

* "mega16" must first open ATmega16, not mega168

* real-time search (with auto-fix mistake)

* when search use for "7815" file with "78XX"

* invers translate test for when eng write, but search rus (if count result is zero)

* any alfabet symbol - like "new"

* need Translit FIX

* rename for 100mA -> to 0.1A
+= * rename pnp -> to PNP

* menu to open needed element of all
+= * use for menu command "export list to file %data%_%time%_search_result_for_%search_string%_.txt"

* width of window -> static
+= * use colours
+= * use visible as table
+= * show size of file
+= * use commands like "O" in "dir": for different columns in table

* search with commands like this: "vt,A3,N,V15" means we need to find VT ("vt") with current more than 3 Ampere ("A3"), type of element is low side ("N") and Voltage not smaller than 15 ("V")
+= * if some parameter not use - means ANY
+= * a lot of string parameters: "A" - current, "V" - voltage, "Ap" - peak current, "t" - turn-on time, ""
+= * any format search: 0.1A = 100mA = A0.1 = A100mA = mA100 = 100ma = a0.1 = a.1 = .1a = .1A = a.1m; 1kV = 1000V = 1000v = v1000 = kV = v1k
!+= *WARNING! use delims ("," or " " for example) to prevent mistake: v1000ma20 -> may be parse as "1V and 20A" or "1kV and 20mA". True string for "1kV 20mA" will be "v1000 ma20" or "v1000,ma20"

* command for export list (or formatting print) to use with external app (like base or another)
* print at 1-st line command-parameter of founded elements
*

_____________________________________________________
From inside bat-file:
REM make "call mode con: cols=%max_len%" by define all founded strings ( https://www.cyberforum.ru/cmd-bat/thread1671608.html )
REM * a lot of strings to search using ,
REM +* think about bad spaces
REM * fix with rename (auto by Punto Switcher) and wrong shift (like symbols !@#$%^&*() but not 1234567890)
REM * use base of words (vocabulary): "LI-ion" = "LIION" = "Lithium"; "BOOST"="UP";
REM * show elements (in down menu) with more Voltage, more Current, smaller Ton, smaller Rds_on
REM * make menu for open via number
REM * a lot of input arguments to check
REM *+ literal formal for founding (example: current more than 5A)
REM * open browser-link with "%user_text% pdf" link
REM * info from analog base
REM * info from MY base (in the presence in the database = payed by me)
REM * in the end print list of AppNotes by tag "use-%APPnote_name%" (in finding it will be "_INFO" and "%APPnote_name%"). Example: MC34063 and AN920 appnote
REM * in the end print list of USES_WITH by tag "with-%Component_name%". Example: "__TP4056__8Vinmax_TempSenceInput_2led_SOP8_with-8205_with-DW01" use "DW01" driver and "8205" mosfets
REM * in finding use "SC34063" and "NCV34063" in "PWR_DCDC_1.5A_DWN_UP_INV__MC34063_SC_NCV__"
REM * in finding "MCP73831(2)" = "MCP73831" and "MCP73832"
REM * RUS coding in search (KP707 = ЉЏ707)
REM += * Translit FIX needed
REM * In "dcdc" use "ALL" for (LT1370) "It can be operated in all standard switching configurations including boost, buck, flyback, forward, inverting and "Cuk.""
REM * If nothing found use finding for pre "-" symbol and post "-" symbol

REM in command line use:
REM cls && set "to_replace=1234__"  && set "to_find=VT_MN_" && setlocal enabledelayedexpansion && for /f "tokens=*" %i in ('dir /b ^| find /i "%to_find%"') do ( echo. & echo. && echo Founded "%i" && echo. && set "asd=%i" && call echo ren "%asd%" "%asd:%to_find%=%to_replace%%" )
