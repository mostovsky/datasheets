* rename for 100mA -> to 0.1A

* menu to open needed element of all
+= * use for menu command "export list to file %data%_%time%_search_result_for_%search_string%_.txt"

* show size of file

* width of window -> static
+= * use colours
+= * use visible as table

* search with commands like this: "vt,A3,N,V15" means we need to find VT ("vt") with current more than 3 Ampere ("A3"), type of element is low side ("N") and Voltage not smaller than 15 ("V")
+= * if some parameter not use - means ANY
+= * a lot of string parameters: "A" - current, "V" - voltage, "Ap" - peak current, "t" - turn-on time, ""
+= * any format search: 0.1A = 100mA = A0.1 = A100mA

* command for export list (or formatting print) to use with external app (like base or another)
* print at 1-st line command-parameter of founded elements
