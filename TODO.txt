TODO

* 

* add "all" for open all founded items

* cannot start in command to multiple search (can't use "| find /i %sometext%") - it's bad

* add forced search by word "search" or "find"

* add if serch in path open as dir if "dir" was added in ask

* in internet search use only english-letters

* "mega16" must first open ATmega16, not mega168

* real-time search (with auto-fix mistake)

* when search use for "7815" file with "78XX"

* invers translate test for when eng write, but search rus (if count result is zero)

* any alfabet symbol - like "new"

* need Translit FIX

* rename for 100mA -> to 0.1A
+= * rename pnp -> to PNP

* menu to open needed element of all
+= * use for menu command "export list to file %data%_%time%_search_result_for_%search_string%_.txt"

* width of window -> static
+= * use colours
+= * use visible as table
+= * show size of file
+= * use commands like "O" in "dir": for different columns in table

* search with commands like this: "vt,A3,N,V15" means we need to find VT ("vt") with current more than 3 Ampere ("A3"), type of element is low side ("N") and Voltage not smaller than 15 ("V")
+= * if some parameter not use - means ANY
+= * a lot of string parameters: "A" - current, "V" - voltage, "Ap" - peak current, "t" - turn-on time, ""
+= * any format search: 0.1A = 100mA = A0.1 = A100mA = mA100 = 100ma = a0.1 = a.1 = .1a = .1A = a.1m; 1kV = 1000V = 1000v = v1000 = kV = v1k
!+= *WARNING! use delims ("," or " " for example) to prevent mistake: v1000ma20 -> may be parse as "1V and 20A" or "1kV and 20mA". True string for "1kV 20mA" will be "v1000 ma20" or "v1000,ma20"

* command for export list (or formatting print) to use with external app (like base or another)
* print at 1-st line command-parameter of founded elements
*
